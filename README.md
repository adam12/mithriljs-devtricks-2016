# MithrilJS

These are the slides / source code for a presentation I made covering
Mithril.

This was presented at [DevTricks](http://softwareniagara.com/#devtricks) in
2016.

Some of the slide content was borrowed from Leo Horie, author of Mithril, with permission. Much thanks :)

The presentation uses [Deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js).
